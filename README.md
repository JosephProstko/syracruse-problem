# syracruse-problem
This program calculates a sequence using the Collatz conjecture, also known as the Syracruse problem, of a positive integer entered by the user. This conjecture states that the sequence will always reach 1 if an even number in the sequence is divided by 2 and an odd number in the sequence is multiplied by 3 and incremented by 1.
